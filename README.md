# HCI Industry project: Haptic factory planning model table
## Technical MVP
  - QR code detection for id and position
  - The co-pilot first indicates the position on a display (according to the chess/battleship principle A3, Cx, ... )
  - Manual positioning of the blocks by the team -> table is tracked by a camera sending feedback to the co-pilot
## Setup development environment (UIFlow) + M5 Stack components
In general: Before using the M5 stack hardware, each component must be burned with the right firmware (choose in M5 Burner)
